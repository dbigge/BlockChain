## Background

This design document outlines the architecture for a website that serves as a front-end interface to interact with a Solidity smart contract. The contract is deployed on both PulseChain and Ethereum blockchains, catering to users of the tewkenaire.io/hextew platform. The site will provide functionalities such as account balance viewing, token transactions, staking, depositing, rolling, and withdrawing.

## Requirements

### Must Have
- Interface for interacting with the Solidity smart contract.
- Support for PulseChain and Ethereum blockchains.
- Integration with Metamask and Rabby wallets, including hardware wallets through these services.
- Functions to view account balances, stake tokens, buy, sell, deposit, roll, and withdraw tokens.
- Real-time transaction status updates.

### Should Have
- Responsive design for various devices.
- Transaction history feature.
- Light and dark mode UI settings.

### Could Have
- Advanced analytics for staking.
- Additional wallet provider support.

### Won't Have
- Multi-language support.
- Other blockchain integrations.

## Method

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** Anvil for UI, Web3.js for blockchain interactions.
- **Backend:** Anvil's server-side Python environment.
- **Wallet Integration:** Metamask and Rabby for user authentication and transactions.

### Architecture Design
- The frontend communicates with the blockchain via Web3.js, allowing users to interact with the smart contract.
- Anvil manages backend processes and integrates with the frontend seamlessly.
- User preferences like UI themes are stored using Anvil's built-in database.

## Implementation

1. **Frontend Development:**
   - Build UI components in Anvil.
   - Integrate Web3.js for blockchain interactions.
2. **Backend Development:**
   - Develop necessary backend logic in Python.
   - Handle user session and data management.
3. **Smart Contract Integration:**
   - Connect frontend with smart contracts for transactional operations.
4. **Testing:**
   - Conduct unit, integration, and user acceptance tests.

## Milestones

1. **Environment Setup and Initial Design:** 1 week
2. **Frontend and Backend Development:** 3 weeks
3. **Testing and Bug Fixes:** 2 weeks
4. **Deployment and Initial Feedback:** 1 week
5. **Iterative Enhancement:** Ongoing

## Gathering Results

- Monitor application performance and user feedback.
- Continuously iterate based on feedback and performance data to enhance the application.
